        Hi! We are Clarissa and Darby, a human and a dog who believe in a better way of dog sitting. Pawstay is a personally-owned and home-based dog boarding and daycare. Here, your dog will be treated as family, well taken care of, pampered with cuddles and belly rubs, and have a time full of love.
        <br/>
        <br/>Pawstay takes place at our townhome, located in Rolling Meadows - Illinois, near New Wilke Rd. and Algonquin Rd. Our neighborhood is dog-friendly and there are many open areas where dogs can walk, explore, or hang out.
